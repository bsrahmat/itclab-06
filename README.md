# Required program files:

The files needed to run the iTCLab Kit test using PID Controller, namely:
1. Programs must be uploaded in the iTCLab Kit (05-iTCLab_PID.ino) https://github.com/bsrahmat/itclab-06/blob/main/05-iTCLab_PID.ino.
2. Module Program File (itclab.py) https://github.com/bsrahmat/itclab-06/blob/main/itclab.py.
3. Script Program to run the iTCLab Kit Testing process using Python Jupyter Notebook (iTCLab-PID-01.ipynb) https://github.com/bsrahmat/itclab-06/blob/main/iTCLab-PID-01.ipynb.

The programs above are the development of programs that have been made by the BYU Campus.

The following pictures are examples of the test results.

To easily understand how to program the PID-iTCLab control system using the Arduino and Python, you can read the following tutorial (Indonesian version): https://www.academia.edu/101744056.

Complete PID-iTCLab control results can also be read in the following PDF file : https://www.academia.edu/101755925.

The PID-iTCLab control results above are compared with the Energy Balance Dynamic Modeling results. The result is outstanding. The results of the PID-iTCLab control are towards the expected Set Point. Energy Balance Dynamic Modeling also shows good performance, indicated by a similar dynamic pattern. The results of PID-iTCLab control are shown in the following video:

In practice, it can be implemented in the Internet-Based Temperature Control Lab (iTCLab) Kit.

# iTCLab

iTCLab - Internet-Based Temperature Control Lab. Temperature control kit for feedback control applications with an ESP32 Microcontroller, LED, two heaters, and two temperature sensors. The heating power output is adjusted to maintain the desired temperature setpoint. Heat energy from the heater is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation to the temperature sensor. Heat is also transferred from the device to the environment.

# About these iTCLab kits :
- It is inspired by <a href="https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl" target="_blank">The TCLab Product of Brigham Young University (BYU), one of the private campuses in Provo, Utah, United States of America.</a>
- Miniature Control System in a Pocket.
- Practical IoT Learning Package Tools.
- IoT programming Kits.
- IoT-Based Control System Practice Devices.
- It can be used to learn System Dynamics and Control Systems.
- It can be used to learn Arduino and Python programming.
- It can be used to learn AI and Machine Learning Programming.
- And others.

The underlying difference between TCLab and BYU's TCLab product is replacing the Arduino Uno microcontroller with ESP32. Using this ESP32, iTCLab can connect to the Internet of Things (IoT).
